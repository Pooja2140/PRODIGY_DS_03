Task 3 - Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In Task 3 of my project, I focused on building a decision tree classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI ML Repository. Here's a snapshot of my accomplishments:

âœ… Classifier Construction: Successfully built a decision tree model to predict customer purchasing behavior.

âœ… Feature Analysis: Identified critical demographic and behavioral features influencing purchasing decisions.

âœ… Model Validation: Rigorously evaluated and validated the model's performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.

ðŸ§  Knowledge Gained:
This task fortified my proficiency in machine learning techniques, particularly in constructing decision tree classifiers. Additionally, it deepened my understanding of feature importance in predictive modeling.
